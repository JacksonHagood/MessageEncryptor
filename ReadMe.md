Message encryptor and decryptor code. Encrypts messages with an Affine cipher (keys set by DIP switch) as audio files. Audio files can be recorded by any phone or audio recorder. Audio files can be decrypted with the same DIP switch configuration. Works on a Raspberry Pi with push buttons, LCD, MCP 3008, and DIP switch. Final project for CSCE 462, cloned from my Texas A&M University GitHub (hagoojac).
