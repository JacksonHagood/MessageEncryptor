Message encryptor and decryptor implemented with a Raspberry Pi 3. Encrypts messages with an Affine cipher (keys determined by a DIP switch). Messages are stored and played as audio files. Audio files can be recorded by any phone or audio recorder. Audio files can be then decrypted by another instance of the device with the same DIP switch configuration. Final project for CSCE 462.
